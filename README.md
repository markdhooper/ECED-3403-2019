I'm also looking to do video tutorials if there is enough interest on my YouTube Channel:

Current Examples:
  - variableTypes.cpp                   
  - arraysAndPointers.cpp
  - structsAndUnions.cpp
  - stringParsing.cpp     (use stringParsing.txt for an input file to test it out)

I'm happy to help with any questions you may have. Send me an email at mr876805@dal.ca, just give me some time to respond, or better yet meet up with me in person.
